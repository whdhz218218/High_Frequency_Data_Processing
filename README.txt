    There are two source folders: junit and src. 
    First, please create a folder named "new" under "Merge" project, then all the results files will appear in this file. And copy the "trades" folder to the project "Merge".
    The final result is in the "Main.java" under merge package. If you run the "Main.java" file, there will be two folders appear in the "new" folder, one is "20070620", the other is "20070621". Each folder has 8 files: four are _1 files, two are _2 files, one is _3 file.
    If you want to run the junit test,  please run the "Test_DATDBReader.java" after running the "Test_FileRewriter.java". Then, there will be five files under "new" folder in your workspace. And if you run the "Test_Merge.java", there will be a _2 file appear in the folder. The "Test_MergeAndJoin.java" file is what Lee gives us so there are several errors in it.
